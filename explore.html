            Electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors) consist of two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers of opposite polarity to the electrode's polarity. For example, positively polarized electrodes will have a layer of negative ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface along with a charge-balancing layer of positive ions adsorbing onto the negative layer. The opposite is true for the negatively polarized electrode.<br><br>
            Additionally, depending on electrode material and surface shape, some ions may permeate the double layer becoming specifically adsorbed ions and contribute with pseudocapacitance to the total capacitance of the supercapacitor.</p>

            Electrochemical capacitors use the double-layer effect to store electric energy; however, this double-layer has no conventional solid dielectric to separate the charges. There are two storage principles in the electric double-layer of the electrodes that contribute to the total capacitance of an electrochemical capacitor:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: center ; background-color: whitesmoke; color: darkslategray ; border-color: grey ; font-size: 25px">
                <li>Double-layer capacitance, electrostatic storage of the electrical energy achieved by separation of charge in a Helmholtz double layer.</li>
                <li>Pseudocapacitance, electrochemical storage of the electrical energy achieved by faradaic redox reactions with charge-transfer.</li>
         </ul>
<p style="text-align: center ; background-color: whitesmoke; color: darkslategray ; border-color: grey ; font-size: 25px ">
    Both capacitances are only separable by measurement techniques. The amount of charge stored per unit voltage in an electrochemical capacitor is primarily a function of the electrode size, although the amount of capacitance of each storage principle can vary extremely.

Supercapacitors are constructed with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which serve as the power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material is a very large surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface area of the material is about 100,000 times greater than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled to enhance the energy density of EDLCs, nitrogen-incorporated, thiol-functionalized, reduced graphene oxide scrolls (NTGS) were synthesized. In the voltage range from 0 to 4.0 V, a supercapacitor fabricated with NTGS powder exhibited high energy densities (206 Wh/kg, 59.74 Wh/L) compared to previously reported values (85â€“100 Wh/kg), and comparable to those of Li-ion batteries. The superior energy density values of the fabricated NTGS capacitor are attributed to the nitrogen doping, thiol functionalization, and scroll morphology. The NTGS cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability up to 20,000 cycles, and a power density of 32 kW/h (9.8 kW/L). Our strategy in developing NTGS using a combination of nitrogen incorporation, thiol-functionalization, and scroll formation was to offer a significant potential electrode material for energy storage systems, which can also be used to enhance the performance of the other electrode materials, including those for lithium-ion batteries and hybrid supercapacitors.
